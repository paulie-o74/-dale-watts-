## Design

### Design Choices
The webpage was designed with my own personal style in mind. Cool, sleek, simple design and clear and to the point. Focus was put on the gradient color scheme which works well across all devices.

### Colour
For the colour scheme cool and vibrant colors were chosen to reflect the calmness and simplicity of my own character and the services the website offers, as well as being energetic, and inspiring movement through music. 
<br>

### Fonts
Comforter was used for the logo, The logic behind this was to make it look edgy and different (as it means "turn it up" in spanish). The rest of the website was styled using Oswald for a clean easy to ready look. 
<br>


### Structure
The page is structured in a well known, recognizable, user-friendly, and easy to learn manner. Upon arriving at the website the user sees a familiar type of navigation bar with the business' logo on the left side and the navigation links to the right. 
The website consists of six separate pages: 
- A homepage
- A quiz page
- A discover page
- A contact page 
- A highscores page
- An end page (after completing the quiz which a user can only navigate to by completing a quiz)

### Wireframes

Shown below are the initial wireframes which changed throughout the development process. Reasons include: increasing subject knowledge of UX design and CSS options, removal of bootstrap elements, the need for a cleaner more streamlined design.
